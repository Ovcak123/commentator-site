The hour is later than we think. An AI tsunami is making landfall. It will create unprecedented prosperity, but displace tens of millions of workers in the democracies that invented it. While authoritarians champion digital technology as a sword of conquest at home and abroad, the free world clings to decaying 18th-century institutions, and forlornly blames the unfolding crisis on the very technologies that can save it.
Drawing on exclusive interviews with technologists, political thinkers, and frontline innovators, Freedom Reloaded lays out a bold new geography of the democratic mind through the prisms of Dissolution, Revolution, and Evolution. As The United States moves past the 250th anniversary of the founding of the republic, the inexorable dissolution of the old democratic era needs to be understood as never before if we are then to demystify and intelligently embrace the revolution in technology that offers the only possible prospect for the next phase in the evolution of freedom.
Freedom Reloaded delivers the first comprehensive yet accessible roadmap for the advancement of liberty in the digital age.
